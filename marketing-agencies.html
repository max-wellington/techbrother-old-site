                        <span>What are the primary types of cloud computing services relevant to marketing agencies?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The three primary types of cloud computing services that directly apply to marketing agencies are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtualized computing resources like servers and storage. PaaS enables agencies to develop and manage applications without handling the underlying infrastructure. SaaS delivers software over the internet, such as CRM systems and marketing automation platforms. These services offer flexibility and scalability to meet varying agency needs.</p>

                        <span>What are the benefits of using Managed IT Support for a marketing agency versus maintaining an In-House IT team?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Managed IT Support for marketing agencies offers several advantages, including 24/7 availability with guaranteed response times, predictable monthly costs, access to a diverse team of specialists, and seamless scalability to grow with your agency. It often proves more cost-effective and provides enterprise-grade solutions such as disaster recovery and business continuity. While an in-house team provides direct control and deep customisation, Managed IT Support allows the agency to focus on core business activities by handling technical concerns.</p>

                    <button class="faq-question">
                        <span>Why are IT audits important for marketing agencies?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>IT audits are crucial for marketing agencies to protect client data, ensure regulatory compliance (such as GDPR and Cyber Essentials), optimise marketing tools, enhance performance, and improve operational efficiency. They identify vulnerabilities in IT systems and processes, helping to prevent cyberattacks and data breaches. Regular audits also demonstrate to clients that their data is handled securely, building trust and potentially providing a competitive advantage.</p>

                    <button class="faq-question">
                        <span>What are the key differences between using Mac and PC systems in a marketing agency?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Macs are generally favoured for creative roles due to their seamless software integration and user-friendly design, longer lifespan, and better built-in security features. PCs offer lower initial costs, greater customisation, and broader compatibility for diverse business applications, making them suitable for administrative and analytical tasks. Both platforms are equally capable of handling cloud-based workflows. Many agencies opt for a hybrid approach, using Macs for creative teams and PCs for administrative staff.</p>

                        <span>What are the primary cyber security challenges faced by marketing agencies?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Marketing agencies face unique cyber security challenges, including handling sensitive client information, collaborating with third-party vendors, using multiple digital platforms, and dealing with large data files alongside flexible working arrangements. Common threats include phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, poor access control, and bot activity. Protecting client data and maintaining a strong reputation are critical, along with ensuring compliance with regulations like the Data Protection Act and GDPR.</p>

                    <button class="faq-question">
                        <span>How does GDPR impact marketing agencies and their data handling practices?</span>
                        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>GDPR significantly impacts marketing agencies by regulating the collection, storage, and use of personal data. Agencies must obtain clear and explicit consent before collecting data, be transparent about data usage, and collect only necessary data. This includes managing consent for email marketing and cookies, ensuring third-party compliance, and updating privacy policies. Failure to comply can lead to substantial financial penalties and reputational damage.</p>
